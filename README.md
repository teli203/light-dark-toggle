# 💡💡light-dark-toggle 📴 ⚫️

This repository features a light-to-dark theme toggle originally sourced from Uiverse. While I've made some minor adjustments to the code for this final version, it served as a valuable learning experience. The absence of JavaScript means the current time is displayed directly in the HTML file. However, feel free to customize or enhance it as per your requirements. Looking ahead, I may explore integrating this toggle into future mobile app projects. Thank you!
